Bagel Pico Fermi is a math game where one person writes down a 3 or 4 digit number and the guessers try and figure it out based on process of elimination and strategy. If you have ever played the board game Mastermind, it is similar to that. This game can be played with pencil and paper or a white board and dry erase markers. We prefer to play it with a small whiteboard and dry erase markers since it saves paper.
There are a few variations on the game that will adjust its difficulty. I will share three of the them. The first variation is the easiest, most basic way to play and works well with new players or young children. I have played this version with kids as young as four, but my second graders love it as well. In this variation, a child thinks up a three digit number (with no repeating numerals) and writes it down on a piece of paper. They hide this paper from the other guessers though the person who is writing on the board can see it. With younger children, it is helpful to have an adult be the writer. As older kids get more experienced with the game and its rules, they can take over the duties of writer.
The guessers take turns guessing a 3 digit number. The first guess is usually a shot in the dark. The writer writes down the first guess and then writes a 3 letter code next to it. A Bagel (B) means the number is not correct — not in the answer at all. A Pico (P) means the number is correct, but it is in the wrong spot. A Fermi (F) means the number is correct and it is in the correct location.  In this variation, each letter refers to its corresponding number — the first letter reflects the correctness of the first number, and so on.
